<div align="center">
  <h1>â›… MobileWeather</h1>
  A simple mobile app created with xamarin which shows you the weather.
</div>

## Requirements

Before you try to run the application or work with it you need two API keys. 
These keys need to be set in the [Data.Secrets](./MobileWeather/MobileWeather/Data/Secrets.cs) class.

There are two needed API keys:
- OpenWeatherAPI: You can get this key at [openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Google-Places API: This API requires a few more steps. A tutorial can be found at [Setting up in the Google Cloud Console](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/cloud-setup)
