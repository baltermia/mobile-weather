### Actors
There's only actor in the use case which is any user, really. No authentication or autorization is needed to use the app. The app can be used directly after it's installed (despite maybe having to allow gps access etc.).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- The app doesn't break when having e.g. internet connection/gps issues (could possibly give user feedback)  
- All text is clearly visible with no displaying issues  
- Does the app work on Android Versions above the one specified (Android 8.1 Oreo)
